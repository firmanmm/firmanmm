# About Me
Hi, if you read this, then you have ***found my github profile*** (yay!). If you need any help or just want to chat or maybe play games together you can contact me at any time, though I will answer later if I have free time (especially for games). Only academic projects and open-sourced libraries can be found here.

## Footnote
If you find that my libraries are useful, consider supporting me by donating [HERE](https://donatenow.wfp.org/wfp/~my-donation).
