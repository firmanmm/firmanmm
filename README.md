# About Me
Hi, if you read this, then you have ***found my github profile*** (yay!). If you need any help or just want to chat or maybe play games together you can contact me at any time, though I will answer later if I have free time (especially for games).

Currently, I'm building my web service (yes, service!) named [Rendoru.com](https://rendoru.com). If you see here, you can see that there are some libraries and projects that I develop and publicize. It's mainly used by me to develop my web service which currently has very limited resources. Everything I use or build for my service requires a trait that is a must-have which is `maintainable by a single person`.

However, I mostly use a third-party solution for a professional project (which is of course can't be found here). Since they are more battle-tested than building my solution. Also, you won't see my private libraries here since they are stored on my web service. Only academic projects and open-sourced libraries can be found here.

## Contact Information
You can contact me using email or add me on Discord. However, I prefer to be contacted via email because I rarely open Discord or any other social media app as I don't like a distraction. Also, my email account is linked with my phone which I can read immediately.
